For debugging, run each script separately using:
    psql -d <dbname> -U <user> -W -f ./<script_file.sql>

To run all at once, you could concatenate them together (using `cat`) first.

The database is expected to have these tables of source data:
    `streets` from SDOT shapefile
    `v_sidewalks` from SDOT shapefile

The column names of that source data are auto-generated from their shapefile attribute names.
